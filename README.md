===============

This project involved developing code using NVIDIA's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) API to perform Fourier 
tranforms on one and two dimensional signals using commodity GPUs.

I am unable to show the code written for this project due to a having signed a non-disclosure agreement.
